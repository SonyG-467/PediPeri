# PediPeri
Pediatric Perimeter is a novel device to quantify visual fields in infants. This device is presently in version 3.x and is ready to be tested on infants.

New additions in the latest code:
    1. GUI is in 100%java
    2. Use of a higher speed camera (upto 120fps though these speeds are not accessible at the moment using Processing v2.0)
    3. Used Webcam Capture API to grab the frames
    4. Generating video through saving frames generated
    5. Recording audio for the duration of the test
