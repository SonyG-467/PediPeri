Pediatric Perimeter is a novel device to quantify visual fields in infants. This device is presently in version 3.x and is ready to be tested on infants.

New additions in the latest code:
* GUI is in 100%java
* Use of a higher speed camera (upto 120fps though these speeds are not accessible at the moment using Processing v2.0)
* Used Webcam Capture API to grab the frames
* Generating video through saving frames generated
* Recording audio for the duration of the test
